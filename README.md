# CIS269.WK6_Project
CIS-269 Team Projects

In the early labs of this class we had an assignment that takes checkboxs and builds astring of a  week, based on those choices.

It had a bug that we were not instructed to fix at that time. For this project we fixed that bug. (Sunday transiotn to Monday on) This was benificial to our request to start the Week with Wednes (The METRIC week).

WE also added some other enhancements. One of the enhancements is to add an option dialog, thereby being able to change the current week to any layout/foremat.

Mike Ferreira and Max Potter.
